    <h2>What's the point of this?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Like you, I play Magic, and like you, I hate it when I can't cast my spell.
    So I looked online to find resources on how many lands to play, and the best I could
    find was Frank Karsten's excellent analysis <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/frank-analysis-how-many-colored-mana-sources-do-you-need-to-consistently-cast-your-spells/">here.</a>
    However, while his analysis is great, I still wanted a tool that would allow me
    to do more fine tuning. Since I couldn't find such a tool, I decided to make one.</p>
    <br><br>
    
    
    <h2>How do you get the percentages?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Run 1000 simulations and reports back what percentage of those times you have
    enough lands to cast the spell you want to cast.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>What about fetch lands/lands that come into play tapped?</h2> <br>
    <p>Those are not accounted for. All lands are assumed to come into play untapped.</p>
    <br><br>
    
    <h2>What about scry/card draw?</h2><br>
    <p>Also not accounted for.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>What about mulligans?</h2><br>
    <p>Good news; those are accounted for! If your hand has less than 2 lands or more than 5, then
    the simulation takes a mulligan. This is unless you mulliganed twiced already
    and only have 5 cards in your starting hand, in which case it bites the bullet
    and keeps.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Oh man, this would be great if it could do x/y/z!!!</h2><br>
    <p>This is the first version of this. I might add more functionality if a lot of people
    use this. Ideas include a mobile app and a way to import decks, so it can tell you
    how many turns it usually takes to play your entire hand. </p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Great. How do we contact you with more questions/suggestions?</h2><br>
    <p>My name is Mark, and you can email me at <a href=mailto:mtglandcounter@gmail.com>mtglandcounter@gmail.com</a></p><br><br>
